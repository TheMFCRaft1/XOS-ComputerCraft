this isn't a finished Project i work at this alone and i do it in my free time so there won't be that much updates but i will try to make it as good as possible! In the next days i will write a documentation how the libraries work (Currently there are two: gui and utils). If you have any ideas on how i can improve anything or what i should add open an issue
